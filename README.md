Code Explanation

1. Data Types and Type Conversion:
   Primitive Data Types: The program demonstrates various primitive data types including int, float, boolean, and char.
   Type Conversion: The code covers both implicit and explicit casting between different data types.
   Implicit casting happens automatically when moving from a smaller data type to a larger one (e.g., int to long).
   Explicit casting is required when moving from a larger data type to a smaller one (e.g., long to int).
2. Arithmetic Operations:
   The program demonstrates basic arithmetic operations like addition, and also introduces post-increment (num++) and pre-increment (++num).
3. Relational Operators:
   The program uses relational operators like ==, !=, <, and > to compare values.
4. Logical Operators:
   Demonstrates the use of logical operators such as:
   && (AND)
   || (OR)
   ! (NOT)
5. Ternary Operator:
   The program includes a simple ternary operator, which is a compact form of an if-else statement.
6. Switch Statement:
   The program uses a switch statement to print the corresponding day of the week based on an integer value (1 for Monday, 2 for Thursday, etc.).
7. Loops:
   The program includes three types of loops:

While Loop: A loop that continues as long as the condition is true.
Do-While Loop: Similar to a while loop, but it guarantees at least one execution of the code block.
For Loop: A loop with initialization, condition check, and iteration in a single line.
The program demonstrates each type of loop with example outputs printed to the console
